[00:00.43] I get no kick from champagne
[00:05.23] Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
[00:10.09] So tell me why shouldn't it be true?
[00:15.08] I get a kick out of brew
[00:27.08] 
[00:20.35] There's only one beer left
[00:22.67] Rappers screaming all in our ears like we're deaf
[00:25.35] Tempt me, do a number on the label
[00:27.54] Eat up all they emcees and drink 'em under the table
[00:30.21] Like, "It's on me, put it on my tab, kid"
[00:33.16] However you get there, foot it, cab it, iron horse it
[00:36.62] You're leaving on your face, forfeit
[00:38.07] I crush the mic, hold it like the heat, he might toss it
[00:40.73] Told him tell 'em they stole it, he told her he lost it
[00:43.29] She told him, "Get off it", and a bunch of other more shit
[00:45.82] Getting money, DT's be getting no new leads
[00:48.44] It's like he eating watermelon, stay spitting new seeds
[00:51.33] It's the weed, give me some of what he drooping off
[00:53.91] Soon as he wake up, choking like it was whooping cough
[00:57.06] They group been soft
[00:58.96] First hour at the open bar and they're trooping off
[01:24.46] 
[01:01.46] He went to go laugh and get some head by the side road
[01:04.11] She asked him autograph her derriere, it read
[01:06.38] "To Wide Load, this yard bird taste like fried toad turd
[01:09.83] Love, Villain"
[01:10.79] Take pride in code words
[01:12.03] Crooked eye, mold, nerd geek with a cold heart
[01:14.53] Probably still be speaking in rhymes as an old fart
[01:17.48] Study how to eat to die by the pizza guy
[01:19.89] No, he's not too fly to skeet in a skeezer eye
[01:22.60] And squeeze her thigh, maybe give her curves a feel
[01:25.12] The same way she feel it when he flow with nerves of steel
[01:27.62] They call the super when they need their back, uh, plumbing fixed
[01:30.22] "How there's only one left? The pack comes in six!
[01:33.00] Whatever happened to two and three?"
[01:34.79] A herb tried to slide with four and five
[01:36.57] And got caught like, "What you doing, G?
[01:38.36] Don't make 'em have to get cutting like truancy
[01:40.64] Matter of fact, not for nothing, right now, you and me!"
[02:08.64] 
[01:43.11] Looser than a pair of Adidas
[01:44.88] I hope you brought your spare tweeters
[01:46.31] MCs sound like cheerleaders
[01:48.33] Rapping and dancing like Red Head Kingpin
[01:50.44] DOOM came to do the thing again, no matter who be blingin'
[01:53.45] He do it for the smelly hubbies
[01:55.51] Seeds know what time it is like it's time for Teletubbies
[01:58.35] Few can do it, even fewer can sell it
[02:00.68] Take it from the dude who wear a mask like a 'tarded helmet
[02:03.43] He plots shows like robberies
[02:05.66] In and out, one, two, three, no bodies, please
[02:08.36] Run the cash and you won't get a wet sweatshirt
[02:10.79] The mic is the shotty, nobody move, nobody get hurt
[02:13.63] Bring heat like the boy done gone to war
[02:16.16] He came in the door, and "Everybody on the floor!"
[02:19.18] A whole string of jobs like we on tour
[02:21.56] Every night on the score, coming to your corner store
[02:48.06] 
[02:44.06] There, it is done
[02:46.61] Now that the representative from South Africa has been
[02:48.97] Mind programmed
[02:50.43] All of the world leaders on Earth are under my control
[02:53.81] And when they meet tomorrow in special session
[02:56.18] I, DOOM, shall be voted "Master of the World"
[03:01.05] My plan is foolproof, but just in case
[03:09.92] And what about snow?
[03:19.92] 
[03:13.31] Now, you keep your eyes open
[03:14.65] When I tell ya, start snappin' (Oh yeah, sure)
[03:17.91] Uh, ladies and gentlemen
[03:20.68] I am risking my life to tell you with, with great concern
[03:24.81] That I must warn you, I, I
[03:28.06] You must listen
[03:31.38] Many among you, have, have had their minds taken over
[03:42.29] (What a story, start snappin')
[03:46.48] DOOM, gosh, I wish I'd brought my autograph book
[03:51.10] (Your attempts at humor bore me) Right, lead-head
[03:54.84] You're weird
[03:56.22] Why is everyone staring at us?
[03:58.91] (Aw, I should have realized, we must look like freaks to them)
[04:02.58] Relax masseur, just do your thing
[04:04.81] (Get a good grip on my-)
[04:06.26] What? Why, I'll bend your read-out meter for ya, you little
[04:11.15] (Hey, knock it off, Ben)
[04:12.26] What's the matter? (Oh, Ben)
[04:14.75] You're nothing but a chicken-head
[04:16.79] (You overgrown granite-head) Hold it
