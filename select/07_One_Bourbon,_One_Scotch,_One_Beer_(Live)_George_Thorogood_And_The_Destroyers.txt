I wanna tell you a story,
About the house rent blues
I come home one friday,
Had to tell the landlady I done lost my job
She said that don't befront me
Long as I get my money next friday
Now next friday come I couldn't get the rent
And out the door I went

So I goes to the landlady,
I said
"You let me slide?"
I'll have the rent for you tomorrow
Or the next day I don't know
So said let me slide it on you know people,
I notice when I come home in the evenin'
She ain't got nothing nice to say to me,
But for five year she was so nice
Lord, she was lovey-dovey,

I come home one particular evenin'
The landlady said, "You got the rent money yet?",
I said, "No, can't find no job,
Therefore I ain't got no money to pay the rent"
She said "I don't believe you're tryin' to find no job"
Said "I seen you today you was standin' on a corner,
Leaning up against a post"
I said "But I'm tired, I been walkin' all day"
She said "That don't befront me,
Long as I get my money next friday"
Now next friday come I didn't have the rent,
And out the door I went

So I go in my room
Pack up my stuff and I go
And down the streets I go
I stop down
Now when I got down there
Everybody was really pleased to guest

I go to the bar
Call the bartender
I said "Look man, come on down here"
He got down there
Said, "Whatchoo want?"

"One bourbon, one scotch, one beer"

Oh I ain't seen my baby since I don't know when
Mister Bartender set'em up again
Gonna get high man, I'm gotta get loose,
I want a triple shot o' that juice
Gonna get drunk, don't you have no fear
I want one bourbon, one scotch and one beer
One bourbon, one scotch, one beer

I take some of you folks heard this story before

But I'm sittin' there at the bar
We seat there
Drinkin' bourbon
Scotch
And budweiser beer
Looked down the bar
Here come the bartender
I said
"Hey man, come on down here"
He got down there
Said "Whatchoo want?"
I said what time is it
He said the clock on the wall say it's 2 o'clock
Last call for alcohol
So what you need?

One bourbon
One scotch
One beer
No I ain't seen my baby since almost the week
Gonna drink so bad man
I can't even speak
Gonna get drunk man
Listen to me
One drink ain't enough Jack
You better bring three

Gonna get drunk
I made it really clear
I want one bourbon
One scotch
'N' one beer
One bourbon, one scotch, one beer
